Unfortunately, there is no way to download programmaticaly, 
so download manually from any successfully completed CI run, see https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro/issues/470

Steps:
1. Go to this folder (create the path if it does not exist): `spatialdata-sandbox/mcmicro_io/data/mcmicro`
2. Place the file `exemplar-001.zip` inside
3. Extract it with `unzip exemplar-001.zip`
